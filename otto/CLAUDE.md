- License: Include SPDX license header (`// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`) in all Go files
- Imports: Use standard Go import grouping (stdlib, then external, then internal)
- Error handling: Use structured error handling with AppError type from internal/error.go
- Testing: Follow test-driven development (TDD) - write tests first, then implement code to pass tests
- Testing: Write table-driven tests with clear test cases and failure messages
- Variables: Use descriptive variable names in camelCase (e.g., errType, appErr)
- Documentation: Add comments for exported functions, constants, and types
- Logging: Use slog package for structured logging with appropriate levels
